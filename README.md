django-session-mgmt-util
========================

view, delete, manage django sessions


Edit the script, put the path to your project settings and
the virtualenv in the appropriate place near the top of the script,
now you can run it from the command line to manage your sessions.

I wrote this script before I understood about management
commands, so it is not a management command.

The script will show the possible command line options if you
run it without options.

TODO:  turn this into a management command and port to django 1.5
